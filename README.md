## Due: 26.05.2020 12:00:00 CET

This repository consists of the final project of the course *Lab in Data Science*. This homework is completed by a group of four people. Our group name is called *oh-my-git*.

## Members of our group

* Furkan Karakaş: <furkan.karakas@epfl.ch>

* Onur Veyisoğlu: <onur.veyisoglu@epfl.ch>

## Contents of this repository

### Video file

The video can be found in the folder `video/` in MP4 format. We used git LFS to track this large file.

### Notebooks

Our notebooks are located in the folder `notebooks/`. For completeness, we put previous notebooks that we worked on in the folder `notebooks/Other\ notebooks`. For this final project, only the two notebooks called `Application_compact.ipynb` and `Report_like.ipynb` are relevant. The images used in these notebooks are put in the folder `data/`. For running the application minimally, please have a look at `Application_compact.ipynb`. You can simply collapse the cells if they are taking too much space and if you want to interact with the Python widget only. For the documentation of our work, please have a look at `Report_like.ipynb` where we combined markdown cells together with executable cells to better illustrate what we have done in this project.

## Conclusion

From our side, we would like to thank you for this practical course. We are positive that we learned a lot of practical data science skills which will definitely become handy in our life.
